"Main View"
  LinearLayout (orientation: vertical)
    "The Bank"
      TextView
        Shows current total
    "The Cookie"
      ImageView
        Increase size by ~10% on ACTION_DOWN
        Decrease size to normal on ACTION_UP
        Click listener for registering the all-important cookie clicks
    "Popup Numbers"
      TextViews
        Pre-inflate sufficient number of TextViews
        Offset pre-determined random amounts or dynamically generate offsets on-the-fly?
    "Income"
      TextView
        Shows current income per-second
    LinearLayout (orientation: horizontal)
      LinearLayout (orientation: vertical) (for keys)
      LinearLayout (orientation: vertical) (for values)
      "Upgrade Shop": think about how this is going to be structured!
          Can probably get away with TextView + Drawable for each menu item
            Wrap in ShapeDrawable to look all purty-like (via background)
          Wrap entire LinearLayout in ShapeDrawable to give coherent border
          Slide-in/out via animation when player clicks "grab tab"
            Also slide-out if player clicks cookie
          Slide-in covers Stats View
    Possible ad bar! :D
      Leave as View, background=@color/white

Design Notes

Consider moving Income to same line as Bank so that menuing has more real-estate?

Implementation Priority

0: Gameplay-crucial
  Cookie (image + clicking)
  Bank (count)
  Upgrade Shop (cursor/clicker upgrades only, no animation, shapedrawable background on entire shop + individual item)

1: Gameplay-important
  Income (count per second)
  Stats key/value columns
  Upgrade Shop (3-5 total upgrades, no animation)

2: Polish
  Cookie "pop" on clicking cookie
  Slide-in upgrade shop on clicking grab-tab
  Slide-out upgrade shop on clicking grab-tab while open and if cookie is clicked (use a bool for "the shop is open right now"?)
  Bank/Income numbers truncated to look pretty
  Add "popup numbers" on clicking cookie
